# Interview Homework

Hi and welcome. The application is a fully working Warehouse application supporting basic CRUD operations.

## Introduction

The repository is split into two subrepositories - backend and frontend. For developlement purposes, please follow the README files in the backend and frontend folders respectively.

### Backend

The backend server is the Express HTTP REST API server. Data is stored in the PostgreSQL database.

### Frontend

The frontend application is purely written in Angular. There is a API service that communicates with the BE. Components are split into dummy (presentational) and container components (those which manages or holds some state)

## Enjoy :)
